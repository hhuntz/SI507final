# SI507final
This is my final project for SI507, and intermediate programming course at the University of Michigan. 

This tool works through the command line (and via Plotly graphs that display in a browser). 

It requires plotly and the native Python modules requests, json, and time. It also requires a secrets.py file that includes access keys for Yelp's Fusion API and the US Census Bureau's APIs, stored as yelp_key and census_key respectively. 

To run, simply execute the interactivity.py file. It will prompt you to choose one of the activity options and walk you through what inputs it needs to provide results.
